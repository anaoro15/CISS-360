Joe Cantcode wrote the following code to display the first
integer in the data segment 
to the
console.
But it doesn't work!!! Correct it.
In the code below, the first integer in the data segment is 2010.
But you cannot assume that it won't change in the future.
You must not change the data segment.

Tom Toofaz always jumps into his project assignments and hack out code ... and
ends up spending his night in the office.
He's having problem implementing the following requirement
in MIPS with less than four \verb!t!--registers.
But his manager, Sloe Arnn Steady, told him that four is \textit{way} too many.
Help Tom and he'll buy you lunch.

Write a code segment in MIPS to compute
\verb!9 * a - (b + c) + d! where
\verb!$s0!, \verb!$s1!, \verb!$s2!, and
\verb!$s3! have values of the C/C++ integer variables
\verb!a!, \verb!b!, \verb!c!, \verb!d! respective.
The result must be placed in \verb!$s4!.
Your code must be as efficient as possible and you must use your registers
efficiently too.
You may assume that the \verb!t!-registers are not used elsewhere, and so you
can use the \verb!t!--registers in your code.
No such guarantee for the \verb!s!-registers -- therefore
you cannot change the values in
\verb!$s0!, \verb!$s1!, \verb!$s2!, and \verb!$s3!.
You also cannot use the \verb!a!-- and \verb!v!--registers.
Do not use the \verb!mul! or \verb!mult! command.
Write down the number of \verb!t!-registers used.
\\
\ANSWER
\begin{answercode}
addu $t0, $s1, $s2    # t0 = b + c

Write a MIPS code fragment that, starting with $n$ (assume stored in
\verb!$s0!),
it
continually computes $3n + 1$ if $n$ is odd or $n/2$
if $n$ is even
and store it back into $n$ until $n$ is $1$.
(\verb!/! is integer division.)
The values of $n$ are stores in an array in the data segment --
a label \verb!L! is already created for you (you don't have to create it).
For instance if the user
enters $3$, then the values are
\[
  3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
\]
For instance when $n = 3$, since $n$ is odd,
the next value of $n$ is $3n + 1 = 10$.
The next value for $n = 10$, since $n = 10$ is even,
is $n / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5$.
The values
\[
  3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
\]
are stored at the beginning of the data
segment.
Note that the starting value $n = 3$ is also stored.

Your boss just did a code review and found that Joe Cantcode
wrote some MIPS code implementing the following idea
in a critical part of the code to auto-correct
the tilt actuators on a high speed train:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
if (t0 == 0)
{
    t1 = 12;
}
else if (t0 == 1)
{
    t1 = 34;
}
else if (t0 == 2)
{
    t1 = 56;
}
else if (t0 == 3)

}
\end{Verbatim}
where variables 
\verb!t0!,
\verb!t1!
and associated with registers
\verb!$t0!,
\verb!$t1!
respectively.
He has asked you rewrite the code to implement a switch 
in MIPS using the
jump table method 
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
switch (t0)
{
    case 0:
        t1 = 12;
        break;
    case 1:

    case 2:
        t1 = 56;
        break;
    case 3:
        t1 = 78;
}

so that he can do some 
performance analysis and see if the jump table method is faster.

Implement the following C/C++ code fragment in
MIPS code fragment
\[
  \verb!y2 = x * x * x + 2 * x * x + 3 * x + 4;!
\]
where \verb!y2! is \verb!$s0! and \verb!x! is \verb!$s1!.
Assume that the cost of
multiplication is higher than the cost of addition.
Say the cost of multiplication is 20 and addition is 1.
You want your MIPS code to be as fast as possible
since the above is used in performing 
error correction codes in signal processing.
The project leader, Zig Nell,
claims that it can be done with two multiplications.

\begin{answercode}
        move    $t0, $s1        # temp store x
        addu    $s1, $s1, $s1   # 2 * x
        addu    $s2, $s1, $t0   # 3 * x
        addui   $s2, $s2, 4     # 3 * x + 4
        mul     $s3, $t0, $t0   # x^2
        mul     $s4, $s3, $t0   # x^3
        addu    $s3, $s3, $s3   # 2 * x ^ 2
        addu    $s0, $s3, $s2   # y = 2 * x ^ 2 + 3 * x + 4
        addu    $s0, $s0, $s4   # y = x ^ 3 + 2 * x ^ 2 + 3 * x + 4

Just great.
Bubba Short is not back from lunch.
Lee Pointa said you have to write the bubblesort as a function  for him.
Remember that
the base address of the array is stored in \verb!$a0!
and the number of values in the array is stored in \verb!$a1!.
Just to be somewhat organized Lee told you to include at least
a \verb!swap! function that swaps the integer values at
addresses stored in \verb!$a0! and \verb!$a1!.
(You can add more functions if you like.
For instance you might want to have a function that performs
one pass of bubblesort.)

\textsc{Answer:}
\begin{answercode}

main:           # a0 - base address
                # a1 - size
                addu $a1, $a1, $a1
                addu $a1, $a1, $a1
                addu $a1, $a0, $a1   # hold the address of x[size]
                move $t0, $a1
                jal    bubblesort

swap:
                ble     $t3, $t2, no_swap
                lw      $t3, 4($a0)
                lw      $t4, 0($a0)
                jr       $ra
                
bubblesort:
                addui   $t0, $t0, -2        # outer loop counter *end = *size - 2
outer_loop      ble     $t0, $0, sorted       # if j <= 0 goto sorted
                li      $t2, 0                # inner loop counter
inner_loop:     bge     $t2, $t0, exit_inner_loop    # if i >= j exit_inner_loop                   lw      $t3, 0($a0)
                lw      $t4, 4($a0)
                j       swap
                
no_swap:        j        inner_loop

exit_inner_loop:
                addiu   $t0, $t0, -1
                j       outer_loop

sorted:         j       $ra
