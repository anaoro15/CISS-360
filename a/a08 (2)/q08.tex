You're a software consultant selling software to the people of
Ljutia of planet
Jwercx.
And boy oh boy, they have this annoying practice of using several bases at
the same time!!! Their president Jabba wanted to pay
\[
8356 + 100111_2 - 124_5 \times \operatorname{AE2}_{16}
\]
in US dollars.
Your (unforgiving) boss told you not to accept anything below
US\$5000.
Exactly how much is President Jabba offering?
Are you going to accept his/her/its offer?
Is he/she/it a crook? (You only need to answer the first question.)
