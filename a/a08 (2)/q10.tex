You have just finished a major project on Planet We and the CEO is sending
everyone to a one week vacation on Planet Ew.
Not knowing the history of the two planets, you agreed.
While enjoying your vacation and wondering about the curious names of the
planets, war erupts because the Weians and Ewians cannot agree on the
following problem:
If $a$ and $b$ are digits from $0,1,...,7$, then when is the following true:
\[
ab_{10} = ba_{8}
\]
(In the above, $ab_{10}$ is a 2-digit base $10$ number while
$ba_{8}$ is a 2 digit base 8 number.)

This is serious.
The last time someone casually brought up this ancient puzzle of the two
worlds,
angry words flew between the planets and within hours,
nuclear war broke out and all lifeforms on the two planets were
annihilated except for one-cell amoebas.
That was about 2 trillion years ago.
In order to save the two planets (and yourself)
you have to find all the solutions to the above problem.
It is projected that the wars will escalate to nuclear
proportions within one hours.

Explain your work in complete and proper English and mathematical
sentences.
