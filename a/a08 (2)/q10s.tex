The meaning of $ab_{10} = a \cdot 10^{1} + b \cdot 10^{0}$.
The meaning of $ba_{8} = b \cdot 8^{1} + a \cdot 8^{0}$.
If we make these two equations equal, so
$a \cdot 10^{1} + b \cdot 10^{0} = b \cdot 8^{1} + a \cdot 8^{0} \rightarrow 10a + b = 8b + a$
Then, $9a = 7b$. So $a = 7$ and $b = 9$. But since we have a base 8 number for ba, b can not be 9 and so the only option we have that would make $ ab_{10} = ba_{8} $ is having $ a = 0 $ and $ b = 0 $.
