\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] What is $12502.307_8$ in base 10?
\item[(b)] What is 7A9B.C0F4$_{16}$ in base 10?
\item[(c)] What is $0.1111\cdots_2$ in base $10$?
\item[(d)] Is $0.2043_5 - 0.2043_6$ greater than 0, less than 0, or equal to
zero?
\item[(e)] Is it possible that $0.0x_8 > 0.yz_2$?
  The left-hand-side is a base 8 number
  and the right-hand-side is a base 2 number.
  \textred{$x$ is a symbol in base 8 (i.e., $0 \leq x < 8$).
  $y,z$ are symbols in base 2 (i.e., $0 \leq y,z < 2$).}
  If it's possible find all possible $x, y, z$.
  If not, explain why not.
