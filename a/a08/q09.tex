You are a software engineer newly posted to planet Khais
and this is your first day of work.
You are attending a meeting where the Khais are discussing some software
engineering metrics and someone (someit?) wrote
\[
(35 + 24) \times 21 = 1501
\]
on the board.
You gasp and quickly realize that \textit{they are not using base 10}.
(Now you know why John was laughing when he sent you off at the
intergalactic transporter ...)

People are going down the row giving comments on this computation (fortunately you
are sitting at the end of the table so you're the last to give comments).
You quickly look at their hands - they don't have fingers.
That was the reason why no one shook your hand when you arrived.
So that doesn't help.

With beads of sweat rolling down your face,
you try frantically to work out the base they use in order to make some
intelligent comments. You do want to keep your job right?

What is the base?
