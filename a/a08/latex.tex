\textsc{\LaTeX\ }


In general for regular English text, you just type regular English text.
When you want to type math, you can type \verb!$x = 1$! (i.e., enclose
your math with \verb!$! symbols).
And this is what you see: $x = 1$.
Notice that mathematical symbols are then in italics.
Or, to emphasize your math you can also do \verb!\[ x = 1 \]! (i.e.,
enclose in \verb!\[ ... \]!).
This is what it looks like:
\[
x = 1
\]
Notice that this math sentence is then centered in a separate paragraph.

Most of the \LaTeX\ typesetting commands for this assignment
is very basic.
Most of the \LaTeX\ commands in the files here should give you an idea
of what to do.
So just look at the \LaTeX\ files here and copy-and-paste whatever you need.
If you want more sophisticated \LaTeX\ commands,
you can look at my latex tutorial on my website for more information.

\LaTeX\ is probably the most sophisticated scientific typesetting
system in the world and is used by people in CS, math, physics, etc.
It's now even used in general publishing.
\LaTeX\ is built on top of the original \TeX\ language which was written by
the world's most famous living computer scientist Donald Knuth.
He is also writing the world's most famous multi-volume treatise on
algorithms called The Art of Computer Programming.
