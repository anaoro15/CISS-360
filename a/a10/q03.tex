\begin{enumerate}

\item[(a)] What integer (written in the usual sign magnitude
  base 10 representation) is 0xFFFF0001
  (as an 32-bit unsigned integer representation)?

\item[(b)] What integer (written in the
  usual sign magnitude base 10 representation) is 0xFFFF0001
  (as a twoâ€™s complement representation of a 32-bit signed int)?

\item[(c)]
  What is the minimum integer (of course using two's complement
  representation of signed int)
  you can represent on a 16-bit computer?
  Write it in the usual sign magnitude base 10 representation. 
  (The PC I had in high school had a 16-bit Intel CPU.)
