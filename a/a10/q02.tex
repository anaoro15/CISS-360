\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Write down the 8-bit two’s complement representation of 4 and 7
\item[(b)] What is 4 + 7 using 8-bit two’s complement representation
\item[(c)] What is 4 – 7 using 8-bit two’s complement representation? (Compute -7 and then 4 + (-7))
\item[(d)] What does 11100001 (in two’s complement representation) represent?
  (Give it in human readable form, i.e., signed magniture in base 10.)
 \item[(e)] Still using 8-bit two's complement representation,
    what is the minimal $x$, written in base 10, such that
    $-5 - x$ will give you an overflow?
    What is $-5 - x$ written in the usual base 10 notation using the correct
    mathematical subtraction.
    What is $-5 - x$ in the usual base 10 notation if you use
    signed 8-bit subtraction?
\end{enumerate}
