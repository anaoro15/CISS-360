Implement unsigned int addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
using bit operations
and also the signed int version.
(The unsigned int operations were in the previous assignment.)
Recall that the signed int operations should use the
unsigned int versions.
Also, following MIPS, you have to detect overflow and if an overflow
occurs, you set \verb!error! to \verb!1!.
See skeleton \verb!q05s.cpp! at the bottom of this question.

For your \verb!calculator()! function, use the following code
(file: \verb!seven_seg.h!) for the
simulation of an array of seven segment displays.
The accompanying \verb!main.cpp! shows you how to use \verb!seven_seg.h!:
\VerbatimInput[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]{arith-seg-disp/main.cpp}
\VerbatimInput[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]{arith-seg-disp/seven_seg.h}
Here's the output of \verb!main.cpp!:
\VerbatimInput[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]{arith-seg-disp/stdout.txt}

For this question, put all the code (the given skeleton code
and \verb!seven_seg.h!) into \verb!q05s.cpp!.
Make sure you can compile and run just \verb!q05s.cpp!.
