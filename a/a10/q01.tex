\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)] Write down the 4-bit two’s complement representation of 3 and 6
  \item[(b)] What is 3 + 6 using 4-bit two’s complement representation?
  \item[(c)] What is 3 – 6 using 4-bit two’s complement representation? (Compute -6 and then 3 + (-6))
  \item[(d)] Extend your answer in (c) to 8-bit two’s complement representation.
  \item[(e)] What does 1010 (in two’s complement representation) represent? (Give it in human readable form, i.e., signed magnitude base 10.)
  \item[(f)] Still using 4-bit two's complement representation,
    what is the minimal $x$, written in base 10, such that
    $5 + x$ will give you an overflow?
    What is $5 + x$ in the usual base 10 notation using
    the correct mathematical addition?
    What is $5 + x$ in the usual base 10 notation if you use
    signed 4-bit addition?
\end{enumerate}
