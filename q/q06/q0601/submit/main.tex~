Q1. 
Write a MIPS program gets an array of integers from the user and store
the integers in the data segment. 
The array ends when the user enters $-1$;
$-1$ is not part of the list.
For instance if the array of integers is $2, 3, 5, 7$, the user enters
$2, 3, 5, 7, -1$.
(You may assume that the the list contains at least one integer.)
The program then stores the size of the array in the data segment immediately
after the array.
The program then scans the array of integers, computes
the minimum value in the array, stores it in the data segment immediately
after the size, and prints the minimum.

For instance if the users enter $2, 3, 5, 7, -1$, then $2, 3, 5, 7, 4, 2$ are 
stored in the data segment and $2$ is printed.

Your code should be similar to a C/C++ program that uses a pointer to scan 
the array of integers instead of an index variable.
(If you do not know what I'm talking about, then ... {\it obviously you have
not been studying the notes!})

Email me (\verb!yliow@ccis.edu!) your code as an attachment. 
The subject line of your email should be like this:
