Q1. 
Write a MIPS program gets a string from the user 
(assume a maximum length of 100), store the string in the data segment, 
for each character in the data segment, if the character is a lowercase 
letter, it is replaced by its uppercase. 
Finally the program prints the resulting string in the data segment.

Test the following inputs: 
\verb!"hello world", "hello World", "helLO 123 world"!

Email me (\verb!yliow@ccis.edu!) your code as an attachment. 
The subject line of your email should be like this: 
\verb!"ciss360 Alan Turing q08b"!.
