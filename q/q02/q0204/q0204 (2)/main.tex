\nextq
Write a PCSPIM program that reads two integers $x$ and $y$ from the keyboard 
and prints the value $x - 2y$ in the console window. 
(Note: I say a program, not a code fragment or a bunch of instructions.
It must be a complete program that can run in PCSPIM.
If your code does not run in my PCSPIM, you will get a 0.)

You can only use the following registers in your code:
\verb!$a0!, \verb!$v0!, and \verb!$s0!.
If any other register appear in your code, you will get a 0 right away.

Test your code thoroughly. 3 of the 4 test cases that I will use
are shown below -- the 4th is not shown.
Each test case is worth 1 point.
If your program does not halt or does not run to completion properly
for a test case -- therefore by definition it is not a program --
 you will get a 0 for that test.

\textsc{Test cases}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item $x = -1$, $y = -2$
\item $x = 1$, $y = 2$
\item $x = 4$, $y = 1$
\item 
\end{enumerate}
