Write your name in the space provided above 
 and return this handout to me at the end of the quiz.


Q1. [4 points]

Write a PCSPIM program that reads three
integers $x$, $y$, and $z$ from the keyboard 
and prints the value
\[
x + y - z
\]
in the console window.
Hey ... I say a program, not a code fragment or a bunch of instructions.
It must be a complete program that can run in PCSPIM.
If your code does not run in my PCSPIM, you will get a 0.

Send your code as an attachment to
\verb!yliow.submit@gmail.com! using a subject line of the
form \lq\lq ciss360 q02-08''
For verification, 
make sure you include yourself in your email.
